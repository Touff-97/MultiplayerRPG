# MultiplayerRPG
First commit on July 3rd 2021. Big dump of everything I have till now.

A progression based Multiplayer RPG based on a Minecraft Datapack I was working on (Summer 2020), inspired by rpg systems from korean novel "The Legendary Moonlight Sculptor" and others of the type.

Art direction:
  Cel-shaded / Toon-shaded shaders with a tropical colour pallete
  A lot of visual and auditive feedback on action to enphasize on satisfying mundane tasks (particle effects, sounds, stretching, etc)
  GUI to be determined (for now it's a default godot theme with Monserrat font)

Take inspiration from:
  Art:
    Project Melo: Action MMORPG (before the roblox shit) by Poinball on youtube
    Zelda: Breath of the Wild by Nintendo
  Systems:
    The Legendary Moonlight Sculpture (light novel) by Heesung Nam --> Skills / jobs systems
    That time i got reincarnated as a slime by Fuse Kawakami Taiki / Re:Monster by Kanekiru Kogitsune --> Monster hierarchy / evolution system
    Muck by Dani on youtube --> Map generation feel

Addons:
  Multirun: Run multiple game windows to test the game with multiple "clients"
  Scatter: Tool to scatter assets on a scene

Tutorials:
  Game Development Center: Multiplayer server and drag&drop inventory systems
  codat: Procedural terrain generation using chunks and OpenSimplexNoise
